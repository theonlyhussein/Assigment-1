                 <p> We are a non-profit organization. Located in Calgary Canada. Are mission is  to improve the health and livelihood of children and families in the developing world by partnering with communities to establish safe water solutions. </p>
                <h4> Why should we can care </h4>
                    
                    <p id="div"> Over billion people do not have access to clean water. Drinking contaminated water cause more deaths than HIV, AIDS and malaria combined. We need to provide people with clean water for are own safety. When a developing country receives aid, it fosters education and economic growth. Which makes people less desperate which is breeding ground for radical ideologies and terrorism. All top generals in America agree that foregin aid creates stability, which reduces the need for military spending as a result making the world a safer place. It helps in taking care of diseases, slowing down the spread. There is a significant benefit to us in assisting these poor countries in advancing their health systems to the point where they can diagnose and treat serious illnesses before they become fatal. Second , for their own prosperity, when there are 1 billion people who spend their time trying to find clean water, it is a huge waste of untapped brain power. Helping developing countries can help the world reap benefits due to innovations from a country that is poor today.  </p>
